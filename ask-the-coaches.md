# Topics to discuss with the coaches

## 31.01.2022

- ~5,000 unlabeld images (supposedly without defects); files are not listed in the given `train.csv` file. How to deal with this issue?
  -  remove images from model?
  -  introduce new class for images 'without defect'?
  -  use semi-supervised learning to find labels? (discussion in kaggle forum showed, that some of the unlabeld pictures may also have defects)
  -  are those images helpful at all for our model?

- model training
  - segmentation - how does this work for CNN?
